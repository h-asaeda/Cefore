# Cefore Configurations

This document summarizes the configuration files used for Cefore. During the cefnetd installation, the sample configuration files (all commented out) are created in the path of "$CEFORE_DIR/cefore". The default for the environment variable CEFORE_DIR is "/usr/local". The configuration file is created only if the configuration file does not exist in the specified path. If the configuration file already exists in the specified path, that file is not changed.
Daemons such as cefnetd and tools such as cefgetfile can also specify the path where the configuration file is located at startup by using the "-d config_file_dir" option (See "1.1. Startup Option for Daemons and Tools" in Daemon document). This "-d config_file_dir" option takes precedence over the environment variable CEFORE_DIR. That is, daemons started with the "-d config_file_dir" option use the configuration file in the path specified by "-d config_file_dir".

## 1. cefnetd.conf
cefnetd.conf describes the cefnetd parameter settings. The parameters must be in the format, such as "Parameter=Default", on each line. If a parameter is not specified, the default value is used.

## 2. cefnetd.fib
The cefnetd.fib is required only if you want to statically configure the FIB entry at cefnetd boot time. In the cefnetd.fib, describe each line in the format of "URI Protocol Destination_IP_address".
You can specify more than one IP address for each separating them by spaces or tabs. You can also specify the port number to use for each host by specifying "Destination_IP_address:Port_number". If no port number is specified, the connection is made with the port number specified in the boot option or cefnetd.conf.
When using IPv6, enclose the IP address in brackets ([]).
For link-local addresses, the IP address must be followed (in []) by the "%" (percent) followed by the interface name used by the local node, and the port number must be followed by the ":" outside of [].

> *ccnx:/news/today &nbsp;udp &nbsp;10.0.3.1 &nbsp;10.0.3.2:9876 &nbsp;10.0.3.3:8765*  
> *ccnx:/cinema/sf &nbsp;tcp &nbsp;10.0.2.1:9999 &nbsp;10.0.2.2:8888*  
> *ccnx:/weather/tokyo &nbsp;udp &nbsp;[fe80::fde:3f51:af6c:70cf%eth0]:12345*  
> *ccnx:/ &nbsp;udp &nbsp;10.0.1.1*

## 3. cefnetd.key
cefnetd.key specifies, for each URI, the public and private keys to use for the validation of the Interest and Content Objects in the form “URI Private_key Public_key”. Both keys follow PEM format.
By default, only one line is provided to apply the pre-installed private and public keys to all URIs. These keys are prepared in the same path with the path of cefnetd.key. The matching between a URI and the URI described in the cefnetd.key is conducted by the longest prefix match same as FIB.

> *ccnx:/ &nbsp;/usr/local/cefore/default-private-key &nbsp;/usr/local/cefore/default-public-key*

The public and private keys distributed here are common to all cefore packages and do not make any sense in terms of Interest/Content Object validation. For this reason, it is recommended that you re-create the default private and public keys as needed and distribute the re-created or per-URI public keys to the communicating cefore nodes.
The following example shows how to specify the public and private keys to be used for each URI. The order of the URIs are not relevant with the processing. Internally, the content name and the prefix specified in cefnetd.key are matched with the longest forward match.

> *ccnx:/news/today &nbsp;xxx-private-key &nbsp;xxx-public-key*  
> *ccnx:/news/sports &nbsp;yyy-private-key &nbsp;yyy-public-key*  
> *ccnx:/news &nbsp;zzz-private-key &nbsp;zzz-public-key*  
> *ccnx:/ &nbsp;default-private-key &nbsp;default-public-key*


## 4. csmgrd.conf
csmgrd.conf describes the settings for the Content Store and csmgr. The parameters must be in the format "Parameter=Default" on each line. If a parameter is not specified, the default value is used.

## 6. ndn.fib (Experimental)
ndn.fib is required only when the NDN plug-in is used. The ndn.fib should contain each line in the format "NDN_URI Protocol IP_address_of_NFD_router". Note that this implementation is very experimental and has not been verified to work correctly.
